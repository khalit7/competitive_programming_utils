# Competitive Programming Utilities
Utilities for competitive programming problems organized by langugae. <br>
This will include usefull data structures, common algorithms, and anything that is commonly used for competitive programming and not easily accessible in a specific language.

## Implemented data structures
1. **Segment tree** (implemented in python) <br> 
Used for efficient range queries with the ability to update elements of the list. <br>
operations include:
- Range queries (sum, min, max of a range) in time complexity O(log(n))
- Update a single element in time complexity O(log(n))

## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Fibonacci** (implemented in python) <br>
finds the element at index n of the fibonacci series with time complexity of O(log(n))
